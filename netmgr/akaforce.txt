AKAFORCE
 
     You can force akamatching by using the AKAFORCE keyword.
     

     Format: 

     AKAFORCE <mask> <address to use> 
     
     example: 
 
     AKAFORCE 50:*/*.* 49:500/1 
 
     This means: always use 49:500/1 as address when mail is
     sent to any zone 50 address. This forcing will then
     always be active (regardless of your 'AKAMATCHING'
     setting), and will take precedence over 'automatic'
     akamatching.
