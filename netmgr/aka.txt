This option is interesting if you have more than 1 address. If
you set the 'AKAmatching' keyword in timEd.cfg to 'Yes', timEd
will try to find the most appropriate address to use when
writing a message.

Say, for example, that you have two addresses: 2:281/527 and
60:100/112.

If you write a messages to 2:500/133, you probably want to use
your 2:281/527 address.
If you write a message to 60:100/1, you probably want to use
your 60:100/112 address.

In this case, timEd would try to find the address (AKA) that
'matches' the destination address best.

It first looks for a matching zone, and if more than one match
is found, it'll try to find an address where both 'zone' and
'net' match. If there is still more than one match after that,
it will just take the first match.
