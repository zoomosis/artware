This, for a large part, coincides with MSGAPI design. Transparant access to
messages is provided, for 'modern' message types however with loss of
information. The 'message handle' concept in the MSGAPI allows storage of extra
information (msgbase specific), but this extra information will be lost as soon
as the message is closed (because the msghandle is then deallocated).
