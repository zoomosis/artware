Hi Gerard,

How are you? I've just started to fiddle with the hooks you created in 1.10.b2
to try to integrate PGP into timEd/2.

I got decryption working, with the following the TIMKEYS.CFG file:

F2  READwriterealbody "d:\bbs\timed\out" enter READrunexternal "PGP.EXE" enter
"d:\bbs\timed\out -o d:\bbs\timed\in" enter READfilterrealbody "d:\bbs\timed\in"
enter

This is great! You see a encrypted (armored) msg, hit F2, and you see a
decrypted message! :-).

Now it would be *great* to have some macros with which we can delete files.
Otherwise this macro will not work when OUT already exists (you get a "file
exists" box), and it will import an old IN if the decryption failed..


Haven't got the encryption and signing stuff working yet. In TIMED.CFG I have:

EXECRYPT                 PGP.EXE -ea [file] -u Donald -o [file]
EXESIGN                  PGP.EXE -sta [file] -u Donald -o [file]

TimEd/2 does call PGP if requested so, but the result is a signature without
text.. This is because PGP doesn't accept the in- and output files to have the
same name. So I think it's best to have timEd/2 to look for a fixed filename to
import after running PGP, don't you?

Regards,
Donald.
