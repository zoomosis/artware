timEd 1.30 readme.txt
=====================

(Last updated 2018-02-22.)

Introducing timEd, a reliable and fast message editor for FidoNet, written
by Gerard van Essen. It supports JAM, Squish, Hudson and *.MSG message bases.

Added to this basis are many useful functions like nodelist browsing,
redefinable keys and macros, character translation, support for encryption
and spellchecking and many other things.

However, timEd is still a fast no-nonsense editor, giving you speed and
reliablity as it's major 'features'!


Notes on this release
---------------------

Version 7 nodelist lookup support has been removed since version 1.12 due to
licensing issues, but otherwise the program is fully-functional.

A 32-bit Windows NT version of timEd is now available.

The Windows version is compatible with Microsoft Windows 10, however
toggling between full screen and windowed mode (with Alt+Enter) may result
in unusual screen output. This is because timEd expects a fixed screen size
for the duration of its runtime. This may be fixed in a future version.

Many Y2K bugs have been fixed since the 1.10 release.

Please see CHANGES.TXT for more information.


New users
---------

The easiest way to start with timEd is to copy all the files from the timEd
package to a new directory and edit TIMED.CFG to your liking. TIMED.CFG is a
sample configuration file included in the timEd package. It does not contain
_all_ keywords you can enter in a config file, but enough to get you going
for some testing. This is an easy way to test timEd!

Later, take a look at ADVANCED.CFG, which is a sample config file that shows
ALL keywords that can be used. You can then finetune those tiny details to
make timEd work exactly the way you want it to!

Reading TIMED.TXT carefully will increase your understanding of the program,
so you can make use of everything it has to offer.


Have fun!
