
*  Fixed a problem where WIMM would complain that areas were empty while in
   fact they were not (or that it could not open an area or message). This
   would occur after WIMM scanned a few areas that were indeed empty (and
   forgot to close a file on every occasion, running out of file handles in
   the process).

*  Fixed a bug in the config parsing routines.
