
*  Updated to msgbase code, that also supports Squish 1.10 features. This
   includes an unlimited number of messages in one single area. The
   scanning function was rewritten for this. In most cases it should be
   faster than older versions, BTW.

*  Lines would be written to the logfile twice.

*  Errorlevels:
   254 : error.
   1   : found personal mail
   0   : no personal mail found

*  When WIMM skips a passthru area, it will not write this info to the
   screen anymore (Hi Craig! :-).
