Simple instructions for the GIGO nodelist builder:

     Nodelist Index Builder for GIGO
     Usage:  COMPILE [path] [nodelistname] [/Append]

     Note that PATH and NODELISTNAME _must_ be specified
     seperately for this program to work.  It's quick, dirty,
     and way fast!  /APPEND may be specified if you need to
     run this for more than one nodelist file.

     Sample:
            C> COMPILE .\ NODELIST
            C> COMPILE .\ EGGNET /Append


To allow GIGO to use this nodelist, in your GATEWAY.CFG file, add
"NODELIST C:\NODELIST\".  Be sure to use the appropriate directory name,
and be sure it has the trailing backslash.

Note that using COMPILE and the nodelist index is optional when using GIGO;
it's sole purpose is to check unsolicted email from internet to fidonet.  If
the address can not be verified, the message is sent back to the sender.

If anyone thinks they can make this any faster, or would like
to use the output of this index, email me.  On my machine, this
program takes about 4 seconds; on my neighbor's, 20 seconds.  With the
current nodelist, the index is about 70k.  Source code is included for 
both the compiler, and the lookup program; have fun.
